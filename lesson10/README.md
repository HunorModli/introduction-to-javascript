# Lesson10

Half of the students writes a replacement test, the other half can proceed with the following excercises.

## Excercise: Trello clone with backend

### Task1: Save the state of your board on the backend

Create a node application, with a static file server, which serves the previously created trello-clone.

The frontend has to communicate with the backend. Create two routes:
 - the first saves the state of your board
 - the second can be used to load the state of your board
 
You basically have to use these routes to save the state of your board instead of localStorage. The routes above can save the state to a file.

### Task2: Assign boards to users

### Task3: Event based trello-clone
